# PodmanDB.app

[PodmanDB.app](https://podmandb.app/) is a [StackBricks.app](https://stackbricks.app/) alternative for running multiple MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Redis servers locally. It uses Podman instead of Docker, offering a lighter and more secure container-based solution.

### But, why?
Why did I make a alternative to StackBricks?

1. On windows after restarting, I couldn't start any of the databases and that issuse still hasn't been fixed *(I had to remake all the database again...)*
2. Every time I tried to use it on linux, setting up docker was always annoying for me, plus StackBricks always had some weird issuse.
3. On linux distros like vanillaOS they come with podman by defualt, plus Podman has way better support for linux compard to docker.

# Issues
If you have any issuse please make a ticket in this repo please 🙂👍
